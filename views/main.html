                    <p class="change-color-light--dark">When used correctly, flash cards allow students to interact with information in a way that makes it easier to retain. 
                        Flash cards are strategically designed to enhance and encourage active recall. The format, usually a question on one 
                        side of the card and the answer on the other, requires learners to look at one side and recall the information from 
                        the other side.</p>

                    <p class="change-color-light--dark">Playing and learning with flashcards is great, but preparing all these flashcards, cutting them out of the paper 
                        might be tedious and non-environmental friendly (paper usage). Using digital version of flashcards is different. 
                        It is easy to create, edit and getting rid of unwanted flashcard without leaving any footprint. Further more, 
                        you can explore flashcards that has been published by other students from different areas, which have helped 
                        them grasp some specific subjects.</p>
